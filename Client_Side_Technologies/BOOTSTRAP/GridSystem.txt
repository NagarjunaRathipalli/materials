Bootstrap 5 Grid System
=========================
Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns 
that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works:
->Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding.
->Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
->Content should be placed within the columns, and only columns may be the 
immediate children of rows.
->Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making 
grid layouts. LESS mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.
->Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That 
padding is offset in rows for the first and the last column via negative margin 
on .rows.
->Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns 
you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.

Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.

If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider
 columns:

The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.

Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).


Grid Classes
The Bootstrap 5 grid system has six classes:

.col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
.col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)
.col-xxl- (xxlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)
