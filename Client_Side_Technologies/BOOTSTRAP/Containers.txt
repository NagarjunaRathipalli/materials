Container:
==========
Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are
 two container classes available:

In Bootstrap for containers two classes are available.
 those are  container and container-fluid

The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, 
spanning the entire width of the viewport


Container Padding
==================
By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. 
Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make
 them look even better.
For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding" and .pb-5 means add a large bottom
 padding
