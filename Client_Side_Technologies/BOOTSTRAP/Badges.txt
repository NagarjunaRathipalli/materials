Badges
======
Badges are used to add additional information to any content:

Use the .badge class together with a contextual class (like .bg-secondary) within <span> 
elements to create rectangular badges. Note that badges scale to match the size of the parent element (if any)

Contextual Badges
=================
Use any of the contextual classes (.bg-*) to change the color of a badge:

Pill Badges
============
Use the .rounded-pill class to make the badges more round:

Badge inside an Element
=======================
An example of using a badge inside a button:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  Messages <span class="badge bg-danger">4</span>
</button>
