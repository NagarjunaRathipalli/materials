Bootstrap 5 Default Settings
Bootstrap 5 uses a default font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its line-height is 1.5.

In addition, all <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).
==========
Bootstrap 5 styles HTML headings (<h1> to <h6>)  with a bolder font-weight and a responsive font-size.
=========
You can also use .h1 to .h6 classes on other elements to make them behave as headings if you want:

Display Headings
=================
Display headings are used to stand out more than normal headings (larger font-size and lighter 
font-weight), and there are six classes to choose from: .display-1 to .display-6:


Lead:
======
This is a lead paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs.

<p class="lead">
  This is a lead paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs.
</p>




<small>
---------
In Bootstrap 5 the HTML <small> element (and the .small class) is used to create a smaller, 
secondary text in any heading


<mark>
========
Bootstrap 5 will style <mark> and .mark with a yellow background color and some padding:

<abbr>
=========
Bootstrap 5 will style the HTML <abbr> element with a dotted border bottom and a cursor with 
question mark on hover:

<blockquote>
=============
Add the .blockquote class to a <blockquote> when quoting blocks of content from another source.
 And when naming a source, like "from WWF's website", use the .blockquote-footer class:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
</blockquote>


<figure>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
    Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
